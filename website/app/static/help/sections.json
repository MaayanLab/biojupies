Through an intuitive interface, novice users can rapidly generate tailored reports to analyze and visualize their own raw sequencing files, their gene expression tables, or fetch data from >5,500 published studies containing >250,000 preprocessed RNA-seq samples. Generated notebooks have executable code of the entire pipeline, rich narrative text, interactive data visualizations, and differential expression and enrichment analyses. The notebooks are permanently stored in the cloud and made available online through a persistent URL. The notebooks are downloadable, customizable, and can run within a Docker container."
