## What is BioJupies?
BioJupies is a web server which allows users to automatically generate Jupyter Notebooks from RNA-seq datasets through an intuitive interface, with no knowledge of coding required. It can be accessed for free from http://biojupies.cloud.

## How can I generate a notebook using BioJupies?

Generating a notebook using BioJupies requires three steps:

![Screenshot of the BioJupies website landing page.](img/workflow.png)

1. First, **select an RNA-seq dataset** you with to analyze. You can upload FASTQ files, gene expression tables, or use a search engine to browse over 6,000 public datasets published in the [Gene Expression Omnibus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and processed by [ARCHS4](https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/archs4/).
2. Second, **add one or more computational tools** to analyze the data. BioJupies currently supports 14 plugins to perform exploratory data analysis, differential gene expression, enrichment analysis, and small molecule queries.
3. Third, **generate the notebook** with the desired settings. The notebook will be served to you through a URL, and can be easily downloaded and rerun on your local computer.

## How can I upload my RNA-seq data to BioJupies?
Users can upload their RNA-seq datasets for analysis at https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/biojupies/upload.

![Screenshot of the BioJupies upload page.](img/upload.png)

BioJupies currently supports uploading **RNA-seq datasets in the FASTQ format** or **tables of gene-level counts**.

**Note**: While the user may successfully generate a notebook from normalized gene expression counts or microarray data tables, the tools are **NOT** yet optimized to handle such data. Such results should be interpreted with caution.

The Enrichment Analysis and Small Molecule Query plugins currently support datasets uploaded with **gene symbols** as row identifiers. When uploading datasets with different identifiers (e.g. ENSEMBL IDs, Entrez IDs), please note that these plugins may return empty results.

<br>

## What analyses can BioJupies perform?
BioJupies currently provides **14 RNA-seq data analysis plugins**, divided 
into four categories. For more information about the plugins, visit https://github.com/MaayanLab/biojupies-plugins.

## Can I contribute my RNA-seq analysis tools?
Developers are welcome to contribute their own RNA-seq data analysis plugins for integration in BioJupies. Once integrated, the plugin will be made available to all users for notebook generation and published on the BioJupies plugins [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MaayanLab/biojupies-plugins).

To contribute your plug-in, please visit https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/biojupies/contribute.

## How can I download and rerun my notebooks?
After generating a notebook, users can download and execute it locally using the `maayanlab/biojupies-notebooks` Docker container.

To do this, the following steps are required:
1. Pull the latest version of the Docker container from the console:

``` bash 
docker pull maayanlab/biojupies-notebooks
```

2. Identify the notebook's unique ID (a 9-character alphanumeric string) from its URL - e.g. `5DAHiejHN`.

3. Launch the Docker container.

``` bash 
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -e NOTEBOOK_UID=5DAHiejHN maayanlab/biojupies-notebooks
```

**Note: replace `5DAHiejHN` with the UID of the notebook you wish to rerun.**

4. Access the local Jupyter Notebook server from your browser at port 8888.

5. Execute and customize your notebook from the Jupyter server.
